				Computers are Stupid
			</div>	
			<div class = "concept-description">
				Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). For example, if you forget to close a B tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.

				Html is structure, Css is style and JavaScript is the interactive that changes elements. There are basic rules for website. <b> Ex) wikipedia </b> Has Text, image, logo, etc. Dev. Tool ==> structure of the page as the browser inter. all elements are rectangular. U can read the same txt as on the pg

			<div class = "concept-description">
				<p>Opening tag // closing tag. Ex) div -- h2 -- span -- text -- p -- text // a // a -- text. How the browser know? What saw is how browser classify the html. HTML - language - syntax and rules , basic word = tag --> elements in the tree through DOM - stn. For elements in html, DOM tree for HTML.</p>

				<div>HTML - HyperText Markup Language - the standard markup language used to create web pages.</div>

				<div>DOM - Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.</div>

				Importance of Avoiding Repetitions
			</div>
			<div class = "concept-description">
				By avoiding repetitions, programmers can achieve two things:
					<ol>
						<li>Help avoid making errors - if the programmer needs to fix one part, he was to fix ALL parts as well</li>
						<li>Great consistency - no two different names for same class</li>

				# Adding Style
			</div>	
			<div class = "concept-description">
				<p>Several CSS - style for your page. Most specific rule is applied to every element. Ex_ house law == national law. </p>
				<p>Cascade - go down the rule until found the best one(inheritance) </p> 
				<p> selector - what elements of style for page. Apply for all tags. </p>
				<p>CSS proptery - lot of attributes to use. Ex) font-weight = bold</p>

				Including CSS Styling in my web page
			</div>	
			<div class = "concept-description">
				<p>Method 1: write CSS in the "head" of your HTML</p>
				<p>Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file</p>
				<p>Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML</p>

				# Box Model
			</div>	
			<div class = "concept-description">
				<p>Content - padding - border - margin. Box-sizing: border-box; (this property is new - need browser specific stuff)</p>
				<p>Box sizing: Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels OR set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.</p>
				<p>Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.</p>
